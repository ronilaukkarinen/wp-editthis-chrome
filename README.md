# Edit This

Original [source](https://h1.fi/2015/edit-this-bookmarklet-for-wordpress/) by [@bjork](https://github.com/bjork).

I rarely keep my bookmarks bar open or use any bookmarklets nowadays so I decided to convert this handy bookmarklet into a Chrome extension.

**Please note:** This is modified to work with [dudestack](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack) where WordPress is installed in subdirectory `wp/` so if your WordPress installations are normally in root or other directory, you will need to edit `boomarklet.js` before installing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download a zip and unpack it
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and make sure Development mode is checked
3. Click `Load unpacked extension...` and navigate to the folder this extension is unpacked into

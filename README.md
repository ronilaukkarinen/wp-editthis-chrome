I rarely keep my bookmarks bar open or use any bookmarklets nowadays so I decided to convert this handy bookmarklet into a Chrome extension.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download a zip and unpack it
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and make sure Development mode is checked
3. Click `Load unpacked extension...` and navigate to the folder this extension is unpacked into
